/*
 * Singleton.hpp
 *
 * A simplified, largely safe singleton template class.  Uses
 * std::lock_guard container to enforce single instance creation
 * semantics at construction time such that if someone attempts to
 * bind to this, it is held off until the class or it's children
 are constructed with a single global instance.
 *
 * This enforces proper singleton semantics and is effectively thread safe.
 *
 * Care should be exercised in this class' use.  You should AVOID using
 * another Singleton's GetInstance() within the constructor of your
 * definitions.  There's a good chance you'll get a transient of the
 * Singletons effectively blocking on the others.
