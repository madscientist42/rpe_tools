Rocking Penguin Entertainment Toolset Library

This is a (currently...) smallish set of headers and .cpp files I've used
over the last couple of years for game port development and the like.

It provides several useful design patterns either cribbed from Java or
some of the pattern crowd's patterns with some extra thought given to
security.  It's licensed under the BSD 3-clause license to allow others
to use it (including myself...) so, enjoy!
